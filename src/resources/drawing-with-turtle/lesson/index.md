### Students will be able to...

-   Familiarize themselves with the Wipple Playground.

-   Move the Turtle using the `forward`, `backward`, `left`, and `right`
    commands to draw a shape.

-   Express repetition using the `repeat` command and draw a spirograph.

-   Recognize `repeat` as a form of abstraction; without `repeat`, code must be
    duplicated and changed in multiple places.

### Lesson Plan

1. **Warm up: Spirograph (10 mins)** — Distribute spirographs to each table.
   Tables work to draw a spirograph and discuss how often the shape repeats.
   Each table brainstorms instructions to draw their shape and exchanges with
   another table. Students discuss whether their instructions were effective and
   how they could make them more effective.

2. **Guided practice: Setting up Wipple (10 mins)** — In partners, direct
   students to open their computers and go to **wipple.org**. Follow the
   instructions in the slideshow so that all students can make the turtle draw a
   line. Then, students use the other commands (`backward`, `left`, and `right`)
   to draw a square.

3. **Turn and talk: The `repeat` command (5 mins)** — Partners turn to another
   partner group and count how many instructions they have in their program.
   Then, students discuss how they could potentially use fewer instructions
   (listen for words like "repeat" and "again").

4. **The `repeat` command (5-10 mins)** — Direct attention to the board and
   introduce the `repeat` command. `repeat` takes a number of `times` and runs
   the code between the braces (`{ }`) that number of times. Demonstrate how to
   draw a square using `repeat`, and then ask the students to follow.

5. **Partner activity: Spirograph (20-25 mins)** — With a partner, students use
   the movement and `repeat` commands to draw a spirograph of their own. When
   they are finished, ask them to take a screenshot of their work.

6. **Exit ticket (5 mins)** — Ask students to answer the questions in the
   slideshow on their own. You may use a Google Form or other online survey.
   Make sure to record their name and their partner's name.
